# OliInSeq
Outlier detection, masking and removal in multiple sequence alignments

Outliers in multiple sequence alignments are a common source of error in all alignment bases sequence analyses problems.
Outliers add misleading signal in pyhlogeny or population genetic analyses. They can also result in a model misspecification in model based analyses.

OliInSeq stands for OutLIer Detection IN SEQuence alingnments. The idea for this project was the joint idea of Helena Vizan-Rico and Christoph Mayer. The OliInSeq program has been developed by Dr. Christoph Mayer and was first used in the analyses for the publication Vizan-Rico et al. 2019.
